usage: testling {DIRECTORY|-} {OPTIONS}

If there (is no DIRECTORY and stdin is a tty) or the DIRECTORY is "-",
javascript will be read from stdin and executed.

Otherwise, DIRECTORY (or the $CWD) will be checked for a package.json with a
testling field.

OPTIONS are:

     --html  Instead of launching a server, show the generated html.
     
  --no-show  Don't render the console.log() output to the document body.
 
         -u  Instead of launching a browser, print the url to visit so you can
             open the browser yourself.

         -x  Launch a browser with an explicit command. By default, chrome or
             firefox is launched by searching your $PATH.
